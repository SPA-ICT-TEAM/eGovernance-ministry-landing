              The Enugu Ministry of Transport is dedicated to spearheading
              innovative solutions to revolutionize the stateâ€™s transportation
              landscape, fostering seamless connectivity and sustainable mobility
              for its residents. With a commitment to modernization, the ministry
              aims to enhance infrastructure, promote public transit, and ensure a
              forward-looking and integrated transport system.
            </p>
            <p>
              To realize the vision of building a world-class, efficient,
              sustainable, and smart transport system, we have set up the Smart
              Transport Program (STP). This program will transform the Enugu State
              Ministry of Transport and the transport sector.
            </p>
            <p>The STP focuses on four key thematic areas:</p>
